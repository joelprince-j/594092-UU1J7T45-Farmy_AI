The ability to predict the optimal crop for a specific location is crucial for farmers in the modern world. With the increasing demand for food production, it is imperative to make the best use of the available resources and avoid practices that could lead to soil degradation. The optimal crop for a location depends on several factors such as soil composition, rainfall, temperature, and return on investment. Knowing the right crop to grow can help farmers save money on fertilizers and avoid the dangerous practice of growing the same crops repeatedly in the same patch of land. This could lead to soil depletion and could result in reduced yields in the long run.
